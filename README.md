 ## Intoduction
 This is a word guessing game where a random phrase is chosen and the player has to select the fitting letters to complete the phrase. If the player guesses it, he/she wins, if they guess incorrectly 5 times, they lose.

## Style Changes worth noting
#1: In '/css/styles.css/' on line 133, I have added a hover listener on the class 'key' to make the buttons enlargen and become more prominent when hovering over with the mouse.

#2: In '/Game.js/' on line 86, I added a switch case to update the backround color to represent how many lives are left, and set the initial background in the '/css/styles.css/' on line 27. And being reset at line 28 in '/Game.js/'.

#3: Line 91, '/css/styles.css/', added a text-shadow to the 'header'.

#4: Line 104, '/css/styles.css/' and Line 116, '/css/styles.css/', changed the background colors to be opaque, to make seem more 'one with the rest'.

#5: Line 19 & 86, '/Game.js/' and Line 67-71, '/index.html/', Changed the size of the lives, and updated the images to use a custom of my choice.
